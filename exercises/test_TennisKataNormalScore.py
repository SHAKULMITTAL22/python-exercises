### Scenario 1: Valid Scores for Both Players
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_scores_for_both_players
  Description: Verify that the function correctly formats the scores when both players have valid scores present in `score_dict`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with known valid scores for both players.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with valid scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the returned string matches the expected format.
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly retrieves and formats the scores, crucial for the core functionality of the application.

### Scenario 2: Valid Score for Player 1 and Invalid Score for Player 2
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_score_p1_invalid_score_p2
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when Player 1 has a valid score, but Player 2 has a score not present in `score_dict`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with known valid scores for Player 1 and an invalid score for Player 2.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with a valid score for Player 1 and an invalid score for Player 2.
  Assert: Check that the returned string handles the missing score gracefully (e.g., returns `None` or a default value).
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle cases where one of the scores is invalid, important for robustness.

### Scenario 3: Invalid Score for Player 1 and Valid Score for Player 2
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_score_p1_valid_score_p2
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when Player 1 has a score not present in `score_dict`, but Player 2 has a valid score.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with known valid scores for Player 2 and an invalid score for Player 1.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with an invalid score for Player 1 and a valid score for Player 2.
  Assert: Check that the returned string handles the missing score gracefully.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle cases where one of the scores is invalid, important for robustness.

### Scenario 4: Invalid Scores for Both Players
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_scores_for_both_players
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when both players have scores not present in `score_dict`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with valid scores, but use invalid scores for both players.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with invalid scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the returned string handles the missing scores gracefully.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle cases where both scores are invalid, important for robustness.

### Scenario 5: Edge Case with Empty `score_dict`
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_score_dict
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when `score_dict` is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty `score_dict`.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with any scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the returned string handles the empty dictionary gracefully.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle cases where `score_dict` is empty, important for initial states or misconfigurations.

### Scenario 6: Edge Case with Large Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_large_scores
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when scores are extremely large.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with known valid scores and use extremely large integer scores for both players.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with large scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the returned string handles large scores appropriately.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle large integer inputs without issues, important for boundary testing.

### Scenario 7: Edge Case with Negative Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_scores
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when scores are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with known valid scores and use negative integer scores for both players.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with negative scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the returned string handles negative scores appropriately.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle negative inputs without issues, important for boundary testing.

### Scenario 8: Edge Case with Zero Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_scores
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when scores are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with zero as a valid score.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with zero scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the returned string correctly formats the zero scores.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle zero as a valid score, important for completeness.

### Scenario 9: Edge Case with Non-Integer Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_non_integer_scores
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when scores are non-integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a `score_dict` with known valid scores and use non-integer values (e.g., strings, floats) for both players.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with non-integer scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the returned string handles non-integer scores appropriately.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle non-integer inputs without issues, important for robustness.

### Scenario 10: Edge Case with Missing `score_dict`
Details:
  TestName: test_missing_score_dict
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when `score_dict` is not defined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not define `score_dict`.
  Act: Call the `normal_score` function with any scores for both players.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate error or handles the missing dictionary gracefully.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle cases where `score_dict` is missing, important for error handling and robustness.
