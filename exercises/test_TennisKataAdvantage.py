Here are the existing test scenarios for the function, which are not considered while generating test cases 
python-exercises\test\tennis-kata-test.py:
  [
    test_player_1_advantage,
    test_player_2_advantage,
    test_player_1_win_after_advantage,
    test_player_1_advantage_then_deuce,
    test_player_2_game_after_player_1_advantage
  ]
Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `advantage` function:

### Scenario 1: Player 1 has a higher score than Player 2
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_player_1_higher_score
  Description: Verify that the function returns "Player 1 advantage" when Player 1 has a higher score than Player 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize Player 1 with a higher score than Player 2.
  Act: Invoke the `advantage` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Player 1 advantage".
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function correctly identifies the player with the higher score and formats the advantage message accordingly.

### Scenario 2: Player 2 has a higher score than Player 1
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_player_2_higher_score
  Description: Verify that the function returns "Player 2 advantage" when Player 2 has a higher score than Player 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize Player 2 with a higher score than Player 1.
  Act: Invoke the `advantage` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Player 2 advantage".
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function correctly identifies the player with the higher score and formats the advantage message accordingly.

### Scenario 3: Both players have the same score
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_same_score
  Description: Verify that the function handles the case where both players have the same score and returns the advantage message for Player 2 (as per the implementation logic).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize both Player 1 and Player 2 with the same score.
  Act: Invoke the `advantage` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Player 2 advantage".
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function defaults to Player 2 when scores are tied, as per the given implementation logic.

### Scenario 4: Player 1 has a negative score
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_player_1_negative_score
  Description: Verify that the function can handle negative scores and returns the correct advantage message when Player 1 has a negative score.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize Player 1 with a negative score and Player 2 with a positive score.
  Act: Invoke the `advantage` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Player 2 advantage".
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function should correctly identify the player with the higher score even if one player's score is negative.

### Scenario 5: Player 2 has a negative score
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_player_2_negative_score
  Description: Verify that the function can handle negative scores and returns the correct advantage message when Player 2 has a negative score.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize Player 2 with a negative score and Player 1 with a positive score.
  Act: Invoke the `advantage` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Player 1 advantage".
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function should correctly identify the player with the higher score even if one player's score is negative.

### Scenario 6: Both players have negative scores
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_both_negative_scores
  Description: Verify that the function can handle cases where both players have negative scores and returns the correct advantage message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize both Player 1 and Player 2 with negative scores, ensuring Player 1 has a higher negative score (closer to zero).
  Act: Invoke the `advantage` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Player 1 advantage".
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function should correctly identify the player with the higher score even if both scores are negative.

### Scenario 7: Player 1 and Player 2 have zero scores
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_zero_scores
  Description: Verify that the function handles the case where both players have zero scores and returns the advantage message for Player 2 (as per the implementation logic).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize both Player 1 and Player 2 with zero scores.
  Act: Invoke the `advantage` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Player 2 advantage".
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function defaults to Player 2 when scores are tied, as per the given implementation logic.

By covering these scenarios, we ensure that the `advantage` function is thoroughly tested for various conditions, including edge cases and typical game states.
