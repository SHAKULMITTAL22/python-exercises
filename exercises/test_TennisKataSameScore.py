### Scenario 1: Initial Scores of Both Players are Zero

Details:
  TestName: test_initial_scores_all_love
  Description: This test verifies that when both players have an initial score of zero, the function returns "all-love".

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score to 0.
  Act: Call the same_score function with p1_score and p2_score as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "all-love".

Validation:
  This test is essential to verify the correct implementation of the initial game state, where both players start with zero points, ensuring the function handles the initial condition properly.

### Scenario 2: Both Players Have the Same Non-zero Score

Details:
  TestName: test_non_zero_same_scores
  Description: This test verifies that when both players have the same non-zero score, the function returns the appropriate score-all format.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score to a non-zero value, such as 15.
  Act: Call the same_score function with p1_score and p2_score as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "15-all".

Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly formats the score when both players have the same non-zero score, ensuring it reflects the ongoing game state accurately.

### Scenario 3: Scores are Different

Details:
  TestName: test_different_scores
  Description: This test verifies that the function does not return a score-all format when the scores of the two players are different.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 15 and p2_score to 30.
  Act: Call the same_score function with p1_score and p2_score as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is None or does not match the score-all format.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not mistakenly format scores as score-all when the players' scores are different, which would be incorrect behavior.

### Scenario 4: Player Scores Not in Dictionary

Details:
  TestName: test_scores_not_in_dict
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles cases where the player scores are not present in the score_dict.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score to values not present in score_dict, such as 5.
  Act: Call the same_score function with p1_score and p2_score as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is None or an appropriate error message.

Validation:
  This test is necessary to confirm that the function can handle unexpected score values gracefully, ensuring robustness and error handling in the implementation.

### Scenario 5: Edge Case of Negative Scores

Details:
  TestName: test_negative_scores
  Description: This test verifies that the function appropriately handles cases where one or both player scores are negative.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score or p2_score to a negative value, such as -15.
  Act: Call the same_score function with p1_score and p2_score as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is None or an appropriate error message.

Validation:
  This test is vital to ensure that the function does not produce incorrect results or crash when given invalid negative scores, maintaining the integrity of the game logic.

### Scenario 6: Edge Case of Large Scores

Details:
  TestName: test_large_scores
  Description: This test verifies that the function can handle very high score values, ensuring it does not break or produce incorrect results.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score to large values, such as 1000.
  Act: Call the same_score function with p1_score and p2_score as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is None or an appropriate error message.

Validation:
  This test examines the function's ability to handle large numerical values, ensuring it is robust and capable of managing unexpected high scores without failure.
