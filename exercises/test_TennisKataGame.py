### Scenario 1: Player 1 Wins the Game
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_player_1_wins_game
  - Description: This test verifies that the game function correctly identifies Player 1 as the winner when Player 1 has a higher score than Player 2.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initialize Player 1 and Player 2 with Player 1 having a higher score.
  - Act: Call the `game` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  - Assert: Check that the return value is "Player 1 game".

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function correctly identifies and returns the winner when Player 1 has a higher score, which is a fundamental requirement of the game logic.

### Scenario 2: Player 2 Wins the Game
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_player_2_wins_game
  - Description: This test verifies that the game function correctly identifies Player 2 as the winner when Player 2 has a higher score than Player 1.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initialize Player 1 and Player 2 with Player 2 having a higher score.
  - Act: Call the `game` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  - Assert: Check that the return value is "Player 2 game".

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function correctly identifies and returns the winner when Player 2 has a higher score, which is essential for the game's correct operation.

### Scenario 3: Players Have Equal Score (Tie Case)
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_players_tie_game
  - Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when both players have the same score, ensuring that it handles ties correctly.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initialize Player 1 and Player 2 with equal scores.
  - Act: Call the `game` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  - Assert: Check that the return value is "Player 2 game" since the function returns the second player in a tie.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function can handle the edge case where both players have the same score, returning the second player as the winner, which is a design decision.

### Scenario 4: Player 1 has a Negative Score
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_player_1_negative_score
  - Description: This test checks the function's behavior when Player 1 has a negative score, verifying it still correctly identifies the higher score.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initialize Player 1 with a negative score and Player 2 with a non-negative score.
  - Act: Call the `game` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  - Assert: Check that the return value correctly identifies Player 2 as the winner.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function can handle negative scores and still correctly determine the winner, validating robustness against non-standard inputs.

### Scenario 5: Player 2 has a Negative Score
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_player_2_negative_score
  - Description: This test checks the function's behavior when Player 2 has a negative score, verifying it still correctly identifies the higher score.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initialize Player 2 with a negative score and Player 1 with a non-negative score.
  - Act: Call the `game` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  - Assert: Check that the return value correctly identifies Player 1 as the winner.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function can handle negative scores and still correctly determine the winner, validating robustness against non-standard inputs.

### Scenario 6: Both Players Have Negative Scores
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_both_players_negative_scores
  - Description: This test checks the function's behavior when both players have negative scores, verifying it still identifies the higher score correctly.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initialize both Player 1 and Player 2 with negative scores, but with Player 1 having a higher (less negative) score.
  - Act: Call the `game` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  - Assert: Check that the return value correctly identifies Player 1 as the winner.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function can handle scenarios where both players have negative scores and still correctly determine the winner, ensuring comprehensive robustness.

### Scenario 7: Player 1 and Player 2 Have Large Scores
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_large_scores
  - Description: This test checks the function's behavior when both players have very large scores, ensuring it correctly identifies the winner.
  
**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Initialize Player 1 and Player 2 with large scores, with Player 1 having a higher score.
  - Act: Call the `game` function with Player 1 and Player 2 as parameters.
  - Assert: Check that the return value correctly identifies Player 1 as the winner.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function can handle large numbers and still correctly determine the winner, validating the functionâ€™s scalability and performance with large inputs.
