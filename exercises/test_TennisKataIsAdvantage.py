Scenario 1: Verify Advantage when Player 1 has more than 3 points, and Player 2 has fewer points
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_player1_above_three_points
  Description: This test checks if the `is_advantage` function correctly identifies an advantage situation when Player 1 has more than 3 points and Player 2 has fewer points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 4 and p2_score to 3.
  Act: Invoke the `is_advantage` function with these scores.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies an advantage scenario when one player has a score above 3 and the other player does not, which is crucial for determining game advantage situations.

Scenario 2: Verify No Advantage when both players have equal points above 3
Details:
  TestName: test_no_advantage_equal_points_above_three
  Description: This test checks if the `is_advantage` function returns False when both players have equal points above 3.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score both to 4.
  Act: Invoke the `is_advantage` function with these scores.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies that there is no advantage when both players have the same score above 3, ensuring accurate game state representation.

Scenario 3: Verify No Advantage when the game is already won
Details:
  TestName: test_no_advantage_game_won
  Description: This test checks if the `is_advantage` function returns False when one player has already won the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 5 and p2_score to 3.
  Act: Invoke the `is_advantage` function with these scores.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies that no advantage is possible when the game is already won, aligning with the game's rule set.

Scenario 4: Verify Advantage when Player 2 has more than 3 points, and Player 1 has fewer points
Details:
  TestName: test_advantage_player2_above_three_points
  Description: This test checks if the `is_advantage` function correctly identifies an advantage situation when Player 2 has more than 3 points and Player 1 has fewer points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 3 and p2_score to 4.
  Act: Invoke the `is_advantage` function with these scores.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly identify an advantage for Player 2 when they have a score above 3 and Player 1 does not, which is essential for fair game progression.

Scenario 5: Verify No Advantage when both players have fewer than 4 points
Details:
  TestName: test_no_advantage_both_below_four_points
  Description: This test checks if the `is_advantage` function returns False when both players have fewer than 4 points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 3 and p2_score to 3.
  Act: Invoke the `is_advantage` function with these scores.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function does not incorrectly identify an advantage when both players have scores below 4, ensuring adherence to the game's scoring rules.

Scenario 6: Verify No Advantage when Player 1 has fewer than 4 points, and Player 2 has more
Details:
  TestName: test_no_advantage_player1_below_four_player2_above
  Description: This test checks if the `is_advantage` function returns False when Player 1 has fewer than 4 points and Player 2 has more.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 2 and p2_score to 5.
  Act: Invoke the `is_advantage` function with these scores.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly identify an advantage when Player 1 has a score below 4 and Player 2 has already won the game, maintaining game integrity.

Scenario 7: Verify No Advantage when Player 2 has fewer than 4 points, and Player 1 has more
Details:
  TestName: test_no_advantage_player2_below_four_player1_above
  Description: This test checks if the `is_advantage` function returns False when Player 2 has fewer than 4 points and Player 1 has more.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 5 and p2_score to 2.
  Act: Invoke the `is_advantage` function with these scores.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly identify an advantage when Player 2 has a score below 4 and Player 1 has already won the game, maintaining game integrity.
