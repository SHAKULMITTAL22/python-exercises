### Scenario 1: Player 1 has a higher score than Player 2
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_player_1_higher_score
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies Player 1 as the game point holder when Player 1's score is higher than Player 2's score.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with Player 1 having a higher score than Player 2.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 1 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies the player with the higher score, which is essential for determining the game point holder correctly.

### Scenario 2: Player 2 has a higher score than Player 1
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_player_2_higher_score
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies Player 2 as the game point holder when Player 2's score is higher than Player 1's score.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with Player 2 having a higher score than Player 1.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 2 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies the player with the higher score, which is essential for determining the game point holder correctly.

### Scenario 3: Both players have the same score
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_players_tied_score
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies Player 2 as the game point holder when both players have the same score.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with the same score.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 2 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function handles tie situations by awarding the game point to Player 2, which may be a business rule or default behavior.

### Scenario 4: Player 1 has a negative score, and Player 2 has a positive score
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_player_1_negative_score
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies Player 2 as the game point holder when Player 1 has a negative score, and Player 2 has a positive score.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with Player 1 having a negative score and Player 2 having a positive score.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 2 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function can handle negative scores correctly and still determine the game point holder.

### Scenario 5: Player 1 and Player 2 both have negative scores
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_both_players_negative_scores
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies the player with the higher (less negative) score as the game point holder when both players have negative scores.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with both having negative scores, with Player 1 having a higher score than Player 2.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 1 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function can handle negative scores and still determine the correct game point holder based on the higher score.

### Scenario 6: Player 1 has a score of zero, and Player 2 has a positive score
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_player_1_zero_score
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies Player 2 as the game point holder when Player 1 has a score of zero, and Player 2 has a positive score.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with Player 1 having a score of zero and Player 2 having a positive score.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 2 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function can handle zero scores correctly and still determine the game point holder.

### Scenario 7: Player 1 has a positive score, and Player 2 has a score of zero
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_player_2_zero_score
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies Player 1 as the game point holder when Player 1 has a positive score, and Player 2 has a score of zero.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with Player 1 having a positive score and Player 2 having a score of zero.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 1 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function can handle zero scores correctly and still determine the game point holder.

### Scenario 8: Both players have a score of zero
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_both_players_zero_scores
  **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly identifies Player 2 as the game point holder when both players have a score of zero.
**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Create two player objects with both having a score of zero.
  **Act:** Call the `game_point` function with these two player objects.
  **Assert:** Check that the returned string indicates that Player 2 has the game point.
**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function handles the edge case of both players having zero scores by awarding the game point to Player 2, which may be a business rule or default behavior.
