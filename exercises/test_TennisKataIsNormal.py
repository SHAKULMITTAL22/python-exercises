### Scenario 1: Both Scores are Positive and Different
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_and_different_scores
  Description: This test will verify that the function returns `True` when both scores are positive and different, which meets the condition for normal behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score with positive and different values.
  Act: Invoke `is_normal(p1_score, p2_score)` with these values.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important because it validates the primary condition where both scores are positive and not equal, ensuring the function correctly identifies this as normal behavior.

### Scenario 2: One Score is Positive and the Other is Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_one_positive_one_zero
  Description: This test will verify that the function returns `True` when one score is positive and the other is zero, as it satisfies the condition of one score being greater than zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score with a positive value and p2_score with zero.
  Act: Invoke `is_normal(p1_score, p2_score)` with these values.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial as it checks the function's ability to identify normal behavior when one score is positive and the other is zero, ensuring that the logic for non-equal and positive conditions is correctly implemented.

### Scenario 3: Both Scores are Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_both_scores_zero
  Description: This test will verify that the function returns `False` when both scores are zero, as it does not meet the condition of either score being greater than zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score both with zero.
  Act: Invoke `is_normal(p1_score, p2_score)` with these values.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies when both scores are zero, which should not be considered normal behavior according to the business logic.

### Scenario 4: Both Scores are Positive and Equal
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_and_equal_scores
  Description: This test will verify that the function returns `False` when both scores are positive and equal, as it does not meet the condition of the scores being different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score with the same positive value.
  Act: Invoke `is_normal(p1_score, p2_score)` with these values.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical to ensure the function correctly identifies that equal scores, even if positive, do not constitute normal behavior.

### Scenario 5: One Score is Positive and the Other is Negative
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_and_negative_scores
  Description: This test will verify that the function returns `True` when one score is positive and the other is negative, as it satisfies the condition of one score being greater than zero and not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score with a positive value and p2_score with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke `is_normal(p1_score, p2_score)` with these values.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies normal behavior when one score is positive and the other is negative, provided they are not equal.

### Scenario 6: One Score is Zero and the Other is Negative
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_and_negative_scores
  Description: This test will verify that the function returns `False` when one score is zero and the other is negative, as it does not meet the condition of either score being greater than zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score with zero and p2_score with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke `is_normal(p1_score, p2_score)` with these values.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to ensure the function correctly identifies non-normal behavior when neither score is positive, adhering to the specified business logic.

### Scenario 7: Both Scores are Negative and Different
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_and_different_scores
  Description: This test will verify that the function returns `False` when both scores are negative and different, as it does not meet the condition of either score being greater than zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score and p2_score with different negative values.
  Act: Invoke `is_normal(p1_score, p2_score)` with these values.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the function correctly identifies non-normal behavior when both scores are negative, even if they are different, according to the business logic.
