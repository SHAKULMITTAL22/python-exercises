Certainly! Here are the test scenarios for the `is_initial` function:

### Scenario 1: Both scores are zero
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_both_scores_zero
- **Description:** Verify that the function returns `True` when both player scores are zero.
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize `p1_score` and `p2_score` to 0.
- **Act:** Call `is_initial(p1_score, p2_score)`.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `True`.
**Validation:**
- This test confirms the primary business logic where the initial state should be detected when both scores are zero.

### Scenario 2: Player 1 score is non-zero, Player 2 score is zero
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_p1_non_zero_p2_zero
- **Description:** Verify that the function returns `False` when player 1 score is non-zero and player 2 score is zero.
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize `p1_score` to a non-zero value (e.g., 1) and `p2_score` to 0.
- **Act:** Call `is_initial(p1_score, p2_score)`.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `False`.
**Validation:**
- This test ensures that the function correctly identifies non-initial states where only one score is zero.

### Scenario 3: Player 1 score is zero, Player 2 score is non-zero
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_p1_zero_p2_non_zero
- **Description:** Verify that the function returns `False` when player 1 score is zero and player 2 score is non-zero.
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize `p1_score` to 0 and `p2_score` to a non-zero value (e.g., 1).
- **Act:** Call `is_initial(p1_score, p2_score)`.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `False`.
**Validation:**
- This test checks the function's ability to detect non-initial states when the second player's score is non-zero.

### Scenario 4: Both scores are non-zero
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_both_scores_non_zero
- **Description:** Verify that the function returns `False` when both player scores are non-zero.
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize `p1_score` and `p2_score` to non-zero values (e.g., 1 and 1).
- **Act:** Call `is_initial(p1_score, p2_score)`.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `False`.
**Validation:**
- This test confirms that the function does not falsely identify non-initial states as initial when both scores are non-zero.

### Scenario 5: Negative scores for both players
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_both_scores_negative
- **Description:** Verify that the function returns `False` when both player scores are negative.
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize `p1_score` and `p2_score` to negative values (e.g., -1 and -1).
- **Act:** Call `is_initial(p1_score, p2_score)`.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `False`.
**Validation:**
- This test ensures that negative scores do not mistakenly pass as initial scores, adhering to the assumption that initial scores should be zero.

### Scenario 6: One negative score, one zero score
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_one_negative_one_zero
- **Description:** Verify that the function returns `False` when one player has a negative score and the other has a zero score.
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize `p1_score` to a negative value (e.g., -1) and `p2_score` to 0.
- **Act:** Call `is_initial(p1_score, p2_score)`.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `False`.
**Validation:**
- This test confirms that negative scores in combination with zero do not meet the initial state criteria.

### Scenario 7: One zero score, one negative score
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_one_zero_one_negative
- **Description:** Verify that the function returns `False` when one player has a zero score and the other has a negative score.
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize `p1_score` to 0 and `p2_score` to a negative value (e.g., -1).
- **Act:** Call `is_initial(p1_score, p2_score)`.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `False`.
**Validation:**
- This test ensures that a zero score combined with a negative score does not satisfy the initial state condition.

These scenarios provide a comprehensive set of tests to validate the business logic encapsulated by the `is_initial` function, covering both expected and edge cases.
