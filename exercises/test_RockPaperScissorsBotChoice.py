### Scenario 1: Verify that the bot_choice function returns one of the expected values
Details:
  TestName: test_bot_choice_returns_expected_values
  Description: This test ensures that the bot_choice function only returns one of the values "r", "p", or "s".
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the bot_choice function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is either "r", "p", or "s".
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function adheres to the expected behavior of randomly selecting one of the predefined choices. Ensuring the function returns valid options is crucial for the integrity of any game logic relying on this function.

### Scenario 2: Verify the randomness of the bot_choice function
Details:
  TestName: test_bot_choice_randomness
  Description: This test ensures that the bot_choice function exhibits randomness by returning different values across multiple calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the bot_choice function multiple times (e.g., 100 times).
  Assert: Check that all three possible values ("r", "p", "s") are returned at least once.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function does not consistently return the same value, thus ensuring fairness and unpredictability in scenarios where the function is used, such as a game.

### Scenario 3: Verify that bot_choice does not return any value outside the expected set
Details:
  TestName: test_bot_choice_no_invalid_values
  Description: This test ensures that the bot_choice function never returns a value outside the set of "r", "p", and "s".
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the bot_choice function multiple times (e.g., 1000 times).
  Assert: Ensure that none of the return values fall outside "r", "p", or "s".
Validation:
  This test is critical to verify that the function strictly adheres to the defined set of choices, maintaining the integrity of the game logic and avoiding unexpected behavior.

### Scenario 4: Verify that bot_choice operates correctly under multiple successive calls
Details:
  TestName: test_bot_choice_multiple_successive_calls
  Description: This test ensures that the bot_choice function operates correctly when called successively in a short period.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the bot_choice function in rapid succession (e.g., 1000 times in a loop).
  Assert: Verify that each call returns a valid value ("r", "p", or "s") and that there are no errors or unexpected behavior.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's stability and correct operation under conditions where it may be called frequently, such as in a game loop or high-load scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Verify that bot_choice function performance is acceptable
Details:
  TestName: test_bot_choice_performance
  Description: This test ensures that the bot_choice function performs within acceptable time limits when called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Measure the time taken to call the bot_choice function a large number of times (e.g., 10000 times).
  Assert: Ensure that the total execution time is within acceptable limits (e.g., less than 1 second).
Validation:
  This test is important to verify the efficiency of the function, ensuring it can handle high-frequency calls without causing performance degradation in applications where it is used.
