Scenario 1: Player 1 wins with a score of 4-2
Details:
  TestName: test_p1_wins_with_4_2
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a game win when player 1 reaches 4 points and player 2 has 2 points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 4 and p2_score to 2.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies a game win when one player achieves the minimum winning score with the required point difference.

Scenario 2: Player 2 wins with a score of 2-4
Details:
  TestName: test_p2_wins_with_2_4
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a game win when player 2 reaches 4 points and player 1 has 2 points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 2 and p2_score to 4.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies a game win when the second player achieves the minimum winning score with the required point difference.

Scenario 3: No game win with a score of 3-3
Details:
  TestName: test_no_game_with_3_3
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies no game win when both players have less than 4 points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 3 and p2_score to 3.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly identify a game win when neither player has achieved the minimum score.

Scenario 4: No game win with scores of 4-4 and no sufficient point difference
Details:
  TestName: test_no_game_with_4_4
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies no game win when both players have 4 points, but the point difference is not greater than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 4 and p2_score to 4.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be False.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly enforces the rule requiring a point difference greater than 1 to determine a game win.

Scenario 5: Player 1 wins with a score of 5-3
Details:
  TestName: test_p1_wins_with_5_3
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a game win when player 1 has more than 4 points and the point difference is greater than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 5 and p2_score to 3.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a game win even when the winning player's score exceeds 4 points, provided the point difference is sufficient.

Scenario 6: Player 2 wins with a score of 3-5
Details:
  TestName: test_p2_wins_with_3_5
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a game win when player 2 has more than 4 points and the point difference is greater than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 3 and p2_score to 5.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a game win when the second player achieves a score above 4 with the required point difference.

Scenario 7: No game win with scores of 4-3 and insufficient point difference
Details:
  TestName: test_no_game_with_4_3
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies no game win when player 1 has 4 points, but the point difference is only 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 4 and p2_score to 3.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly identify a game win when the point difference is not greater than 1, even if one player has reached 4 points.

Scenario 8: No game win with scores of 3-4 and insufficient point difference
Details:
  TestName: test_no_game_with_3_4
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies no game win when player 2 has 4 points, but the point difference is only 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 3 and p2_score to 4.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly identify a game win when the point difference is not greater than 1, even if the second player has reached 4 points.

Scenario 9: Player 1 wins with a minimal required score of 4-0
Details:
  TestName: test_p1_wins_with_4_0
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a game win when player 1 reaches 4 points and player 2 has 0 points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 4 and p2_score to 0.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies a game win when one player reaches 4 points with a point difference of 4, which is greater than 1.

Scenario 10: Player 2 wins with a minimal required score of 0-4
Details:
  TestName: test_p2_wins_with_0_4
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a game win when player 2 reaches 4 points and player 1 has 0 points.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize p1_score to 0 and p2_score to 4.
  Act: Call `is_game(p1_score, p2_score)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies a game win when the second player reaches 4 points with a point difference of 4, which is greater than 1.
